# midline-loss

This is a repository of the code used in the **"Midline-constrained loss in the anatomical landmark segmentation of 3D liver models"** paper, presented at **MIUA 2025**.

### Codebase
The `MeshPreprocessing/` folder is used to convert meshes from the datasets provided in the following papers:

- [P2ILF paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361841524002962)  
- [Xukun paper](#)

It is expected that the input data is in the format used by these works. The preprocessing code handle conversion to the required `.npz` format for training.
